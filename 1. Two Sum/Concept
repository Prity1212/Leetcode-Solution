For approach 1 - Brute Force Approach
                 Time Complexity = O(n^2)
     
 Concept you must know :-
  1. Array
  2. Loops

For Approach 2  - using Sorting
                  Time Complexity = O(nlogn)
                  
Note : whenever there is a case of searching element, we can use sorting and then search an element

Concept you must know :-
  1. Array
  2. Loops 
  3. Sorting
  4. if-else condition
  
    
For Approach 3  - using hashmap
                  Time Complexity = O(n)

Concept you must know :-
  1. Array
  2. Loops 
  3. hashmap
  4. if-else condition
